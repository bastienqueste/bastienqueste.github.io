We will be advertising for a new PhD position in spring 2025, for a start before Jan 1, 2026.

This PhD studentship at the interface of physical and biogeochemical oceanography is part of the ERC Synergy project RECLESS 
(*Recycling versus loss in the marine nitrogen cycle: controls, feedbacks, and the impact of expanding low oxygen regions*). 
**RECLESS** aims to predict how ongoing ocean deoxygenation impacts microbial nitrogen transformations and thereby the future availability 
of nitrogen to support oceanic primary production and carbon sequestration, by synergistically integrating innovative oceanographic, 
biogeochemical, ecophysiological, and model-based investigations.

This studentship will quantify trace oxygen intrusions (~10nM) in OMZs at high spatial and temporal resolution using a novel ultra-sensitive oxygen 
sensor on underwater gliders and research cruises across multiple OMZs. This will put us in a unique position to reveal the impact, 
frequency, and magnitude of oxygen intrusions within OMZs.
